# Lowpass_Highpass_Filter
A very basic lowpass and highpass filter design, made with the purpose of self-teaching JUCE, Projucer and C++.

The .exe and .vst3 files are the built Standalone and plugin respectively. Copy the .vst3 to your DAW's VST directory to launch within DAW as a plugin.

The code can be seen within the Source folder. Initially generated by Projucer as a "basic plugin" and modified.
